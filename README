Useful recipes for Cucumber to make common tasks easier and more fun.

CHANGELOG
---------

2009-02-26

Added nokogiri-based matchers for HTML tags, more flexible than has_tag().

TODO
----

Document these.

Collect more useful recipes.  

Add a catch-all matcher or maybe patch cucumber, so that the text of
non-matching steps and existing defined steps are analyzed and suggestions
are made smarter than the current "make a new step" suggestion.
